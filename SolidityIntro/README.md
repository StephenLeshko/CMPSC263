# Solidity Introduction Demo
## CMPSC 263 - Blockchain and Modern Web Development

This repository contains examples of basic Solidity smart contracts for learning the fundamentals of Ethereum development.

## Contents

- [SimpleStorage.sol](./SimpleStorage.sol) - Basic contract demonstrating state variables and functions
- [SimpleCoin.sol](./SimpleCoin.sol) - A basic token implementation showing mappings and transfer functions

## Getting Started

These contracts can be compiled and deployed using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), a browser-based IDE for Solidity development.

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Create a new file and copy the content of the example contracts
3. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler
4. Deploy the contract to the JavaScript VM environment for testing

## Key Solidity Concepts Demonstrated

- Contract structure
- Data types (uint, address, bool)
- State variables vs local variables
- Functions and visibility modifiers (public, private)
- Function modifiers (view, pure, payable)
- Mappings
- Events
- Constructors
- Error handling with require statements
